### Comparisons
* [Code emitting telemetry events](https://github.com/scudelletti/sample-telemetry-elixir/tree/main/lib/sample)
* [Tests asserting telemetry events](https://github.com/scudelletti/sample-telemetry-elixir/tree/main/test/sample)

ℹ️ The support directory contains helpers used in the tests, but their code is not relevant as they are only used to enhance the readability of the tests and prove a point. Therefore, they can be significantly improved.
